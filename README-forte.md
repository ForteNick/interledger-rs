# Branch Strategy
Kind of backwards.

## Master Branch

**master** generally contains latest drops from the official repository, plus some trivial fixes for Forte Labs use. This will likely have breaking changes (for Forte code).

## Develop Branch

**develop** is a branch off **master** which is in sync with Forte code and therefore what we should always build against.

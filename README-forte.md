# Branch Strategy
Kind of backwards.

*master* generally contains latest drops from the official repository, plus some trivial fixes for Forte Labs use. This will likely have breaking changes (for Forte code).

*develop* is a branch off *master* which is in sync with Forte code and therefore what we build against.
